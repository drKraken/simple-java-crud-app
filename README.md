# Java CRUD App
Simple java business application with CRUD functional made for university course.

## `Note!`As the project become much visible so I strongly encourage everyone to use the provided code at your own risk. It is very dirty and hacky!

To run it you need to have
- Eclipse IDE (J2EE) **preferred**

  *or you need to install `JDK` on your own.*
- MySQL pre-installed
- some MySQL UI ( I used MySql Workbench )
- mysql-connector

also I used `weblaf` since it has better look and feel.
